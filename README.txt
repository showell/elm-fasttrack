This is an implementation of Fast Track in Elm.
It's still very much a work in progress.

HOW TO BUILD:

    elm make --optimize ft.elm --output ft.html

TODO:
    rename all_cards, config_all_cards, etc.
    Model -> Type (perform_move)
    kills (piece -> holding pen)
    Turn type
    initial deal of 5 cards
    force user to play a card
    get-out pile
    disable deck once move starts
