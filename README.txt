This is an implementation of Fast Track in Elm.
It's still very much a work in progress.

HOW TO BUILD:

    elm make --optimize ft.elm --output ft.html

TODO:
    rearrange UI so deck is less jumpy
    hide Deck

    prevent rotate until non-face card played 
    extract piece code
    have landing screen between players
    change "Square" terminology (and use circles)
    get-out pile
    add title hovers for squares
    disable deck once move starts
    basic undo
    jack swap/kill
    upgrade elm-format, re-run
