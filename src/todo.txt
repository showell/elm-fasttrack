The following list of todos are just under source control
for the main developer, me, Steve.  If I ever get collaborators,
I'll start filing issues.  (As is usually the case, some of
the most important todos, like adding better comments to the
code, are either still in my head or just kind of an
ongoing, constant effort.)

TODO:

    finish-button:
        put on same row as cards
        style it nicely
        landing screen

    jack swap/kill:
        at least fix comment

    get back to what-if:
        (computer plays automatically)

    mobile:
        fix sizes

    fix before-turn-card experience:
        show pieces that can be moved

    set number of players 2/3/4/5/6

    log moves:
        may need hovers

    UI to pick number of players:
        clean up Msg/Model to have game vs. setup

    code cleanup:
        de-dup getCardForMoveType?
